# Alkamist Scripts
Hi, this is the repository of my custom scripts. I mainly write them for my own personal use, but I don't mind releasing them to the public since they might help someone out.

# Installation
First, make sure you have [ReaPack](https://reapack.com/) installed.

After ReaPack is installed, go into Reaper, and click 'Extensions > ReaPack > Import Repositories..'

You can then paste the following URL into the box to load my repository:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alkamist/Alkamist-Scripts/master/index.xml`

If all goes correctly, you should be able to go to 'Extensions > ReaPack > Browse Packages..' and search for Alkamist to find and import my scripts.

# Support
If my scripts have helped you out and you are feeling generous, please consider donating to help me out. It would be much appreciated!
